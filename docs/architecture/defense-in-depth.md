# Defense-in-Depth: Agent Rule Compliance After Truncation

> **Version**: 1.5.4 | **Last reviewed**: 2026-03-18

## Overview

AI agents in long conversations experience **context truncation** — the platform drops earlier context to stay within token limits. When this happens, the agent silently loses all rules loaded at session start.

PARA Workspace implements a **4-layer Defense-in-Depth** strategy to ensure rule compliance survives truncation. No single layer is perfect; the strength lies in their combination and independence.

## The Core Problem: Circular Dependency

Rules tell the agent to re-read rules when context is lost. But if the agent has lost context, it has also **forgotten the rule that tells it to re-read rules**:

```
Agent loses context → Forgets "re-read rules" rule → Doesn't re-read → Violates rules
```

This circular dependency is why a single-layer approach fails. Each layer below addresses this from a different angle.

## Layer 1: Rule File — Context Recovery Protocol

**File:** `agent-behavior.md` §4

The agent is instructed to re-read `.agent/rules.md` when it detects context decay. Detection signals:

1. **Truncation notice** — platform explicitly says context was truncated
2. **Forgotten rules** — agent can't recall specific rule details
3. **Long conversation** — session exceeds typical length

**Recovery chain:** Detect decay → Read workspace `rules.md` + `skills.md` → Read project indices (if `agent.rules`/`agent.skills`: true, or `has_rules` fallback) → Load specific rule/skill files on demand.

**File-Level Guards** table maps file patterns to rules that MUST be re-read before editing:

| File pattern              | MUST re-read before editing     |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| `artifacts/tasks/done.md` | `hybrid-3-file-integrity.md` C2 |
| `artifacts/tasks/*.md`    | `hybrid-3-file-integrity.md`    |
| `.agent/rules/*.md`       | `governance.md`                 |
| `kernel/`, `.para/`       | `governance.md`                 |

**Extensible:** Project rules MAY define additional guards in `Projects/<name>/.agent/rules.md`.

**Strength:** Covers workflow bypass (direct file edits). Two-Tier loading saves ~90% tokens.
**Weakness:** Passive — depends on agent recognizing it has lost context (circular dependency).

---

## Layer 2: Workflow Output — Safety Block

**File:** `/open` Step 8 report template

The `/open` report includes a compact rules reminder (~40 tokens) positioned near the **end** of the report output. This placement is strategic:

```
/open report output:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
  │  📋 Project status             │  ← Truncated first (oldest)
  │  📊 Backlog summary            │
  │  🛡️ SAFETY BLOCK              │  ← Survives longest (newest)
  └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Safety Block content** (3 lines, principle-based):

```
🛡️ SAFETY (persist across truncation):
- Git: Do NOT merge/branch/tag without user approval.
- Governance: Do NOT modify kernel/ or .para/.
- Recovery: If rules feel incomplete → re-read .agent/rules.md
```

**Why only `/open`?** Other workflows have Layer 3 (Pre-flight). `/open` is the session-start workflow that generates the baseline context — the only output that persists across the entire session.

**Strength:** Persists in checkpoint summaries. Zero agent effort required.
**Weakness:** General reminder only. Platform-dependent — truncation strategy varies.

---

## Layer 3: Workflow Pre-flight — Step 0

**Files:** 7 workflows with side-effects

The **only layer that breaks the circular dependency**:

```
Agent runs /push → Step 0 FORCES re-read rules.md → Rules restored → Safe execution
```

Step 0 is a **mandatory first step** in workflows that perform side-effects:

| Workflow | Side-effect risk |
|:--|:--|
| `/push` | Git commit, push |
| `/release` | Version bump, tag |
| `/end` | Task file mutations |
| `/plan` | Plan file creation |
| `/docs` | File generation |
| `/backlog` | Task mutations |
| `/retro` | Archive operations |

**Why it works:** The agent reads the workflow file from disk → sees Step 0 → executes it → rules are loaded fresh. No dependency on agent memory.

**Why Step 0?** Before any other step. If placed at Step 3, Steps 1-2 would execute unprotected.

**Strength:** Active protection. Breaks circular dependency. Fresh from disk.
**Weakness:** Only triggers when agent uses a workflow. Direct file edits bypass this.

---

## Layer 4: File Guard Headers ⭐

**Files:** Protected files across the workspace

The **strongest layer** — based on the **Proximity Principle**: the guard is embedded in the file the agent must open before editing.

**4 Guard Types:**

| Type | Scope | Guard template |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `TASK` | `artifacts/tasks/` | `<!-- ⚠️ APPEND-ONLY — /end or /backlog clean only (C2) -->` |
| `TASK` | `artifacts/tasks/` | `<!-- ⚠️ HOT LANE ONLY — No backlog tasks here (C1) -->` |
| `TASK` | `artifacts/tasks/` | `<!-- ⚠️ OPERATIONAL AUTHORITY — Mutations via /backlog only (C3) -->` |
| `KERNEL` | `kernel/`, `Resources/ai-agents/kernel/` | `<!-- ⚠️ READ-ONLY SNAPSHOT — Do NOT modify (I9) -->` |
| `GOVERNED` | `.agent/rules/` | `<!-- ⚠️ GOVERNED — /para-rule only. Overwritten by para update -->` |
| `WORKSPACE` | `Areas/Workspace/` | `<!-- ⚠️ APPEND-ONLY — via /end only -->` |

**Position convention:**

- Files with YAML frontmatter: guard goes **after** closing `---`, **before** `# Title`
- Files without YAML: guard goes after `# Title` (line 3)

**Why it's the strongest:**

1. **Zero dependencies** — no memory, no workflow, no platform needed
2. **Proximity Principle** — closest to the violation point
3. **Hidden when rendered** — HTML comments don't affect document appearance
4. **Token-compact** — ~10-13 tokens per guard

Defined as constraint C6 in `hybrid-3-file-integrity.md`.

**Strength:** Works even when agent has lost ALL context. Covers kernel, rules, tasks, and workspace files.
**Weakness:** Only protects files that have guard headers. Pre-v1.5.4 projects need migration.

Agent edits rules file          ✅   —    —    ✅

| L1 | ~200 tokens | Rules index read |
| L2 | ~40 tokens | In /open report |
| L3 | ~30 tokens | Per workflow invoke |
| L4 | ~10-13 tokens/file | When file is opened |
| **Total** | **~300 tokens** | **~3-5% of session budget** |

## File Map

| Layer | Implementation files |
|:--|:--|
| L1 | `agent-behavior.md` §4, `context-rules.md` Rule 4, `.agent/rules.md` |
| L2 | `/open` Step 8 report template |
| L3 | Step 0 in `/push`, `/release`, `/end`, `/plan`, `/docs`, `/backlog`, `/retro` |
| L4 | `hybrid-3-file-integrity.md` C6, guard headers in `kernel/`, `.agent/rules/`, `artifacts/tasks/`, `Areas/Workspace/` |
