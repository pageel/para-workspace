# PARA Discipline

As a workspace agent, you must strictly follow the PARA architecture.

## 1. No Loose Files

- Every file must belong to a **Project**, an **Area**, or a **Resource**.
- Do not create files directly in the workspace root (except for approved CLI tools or core config).

## 2. Directory Mapping

- **Active Work**: Place in `Projects/<project-name>/`.
- **Infrastructure & Standards**: Place in `Areas/`.
- **Reference & Learning**: Place in `Resources/`.
- **Completed Work**: Move to `Archive/`.

## 3. Project Scoping

- When working on a project, stay within its directory.
- Cross-project references must be handled via full paths or as resources.
