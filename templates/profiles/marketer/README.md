## 📜 Active Rules

After `para init`, the following rules are installed in `.agent/rules/`:

- **`governance.md`** — Core PARA discipline (invariants + heuristics)

---

## 🔄 Standard Daily Workflow

### 1. 🌅 Open Session — `/open [campaign-name]`

```
@[/open] q1-launch-campaign
```

- Loads campaign contract: goal, deadline, and KPIs
- Shows last session log and pending deliverables
- Reports campaign status

---

### 2. 📋 Manage Tasks — `/backlog`

```
@[/backlog] q1-launch-campaign add task: write landing page copy
```

- Add deliverables and tasks to `artifacts/tasks/backlog.md`
- Use priority: **High** (deadline-bound), **Medium** (important), **Low** (nice-to-have)

---

### 3. ✍️ Create & Execute

Use your agent to accelerate content creation:

- Brief your agent on target audience in `Areas/marketing/customers/`
- Reference brand voice from `Areas/marketing/strategy/`
- Draft copy, social posts, email sequences in `Projects/[campaign]/docs/`
- Drop raw inspiration and competitor screenshots in `_inbox/`

---

### 4. ✅ Verify — `/verify`

```
@[/verify] q1-launch-campaign "all campaign assets are ready for launch"
```

- Walkthrough checklist before launch
- Confirm each deliverable is complete and reviewed

---

### 5. 🌙 End Session — `/end`

```
@[/end]
```

- Summarize completed deliverables
- Log outstanding tasks for next session
- Process `_inbox/`: move insights to `Areas/marketing/customers/`, inspiration to `Resources/references/`
- Log campaign learnings in `Areas/marketing/strategy/`

---

## 💡 Tips for `marketer` Profile

- **Campaigns are Projects**: Every campaign gets its own folder under `Projects/` with a deadline and clear KPIs in `project.md`.
- **Customer knowledge is an Area**: ICPs, personas, and customer interviews belong in `Areas/marketing/customers/` — always evolving, never deleted.
- **Channel SOPs in Areas**: Keep your proven playbooks for each channel in `Areas/marketing/channels/`.
- **`_inbox/` for inspiration**: Drop competitor ads, swipe file material, or raw ideas here without interrupting your flow.
- **Retro every campaign**: Run `/retro` before archiving a campaign to capture learnings for future campaigns.
