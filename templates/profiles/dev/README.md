# Profile: `dev` — Developer Workspace

> **For**: Software developers working with AI agents on technical projects.
> **Philosophy**: All code is a Project. Knowledge lives in Areas. Tools live in Resources.

## 📑 Recommended Workflows

| Workflow           | When to Use                                  |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **`/open`**        | Start a working session, load context        |
| **`/backlog`**     | Add/prioritize tasks for a project           |
| **`/new-project`** | Scaffold a new development project           |
| **`/push`**        | Quick commit and push to GitHub              |
| **`/verify`**      | Verify a feature is complete via walkthrough |
| **`/release`**     | Pre-release quality gate before publishing   |
| **`/retro`**       | Retrospective before archiving a project     |
| **`/end`**         | Close session and log progress               |
| **`/para`**        | Workspace health check and maintenance       |

## 📜 Active Rules

After `para init`, the following rules are installed in `.agent/rules/`:

- **`governance.md`** — Core PARA discipline rules (invariants + heuristics)

---

## 🔄 Standard Daily Workflow

### 1. 🌅 Open Session — `/open [project-name]`

```
@[/open] my-app
```

- Reads `project.md` for goal and DoD
- Shows last session log and pending TODOs
- Checks Sync Queue for upstream notifications
- Reports Git status

---

### 2. 📋 Manage Tasks — `/backlog`

```
@[/backlog] my-app add task: implement user authentication
```

- Add new tasks to `artifacts/tasks/backlog.md`
- Prioritize or triage existing tasks
- Move completed tasks to `done.md`

---

### 3. 💻 Develop

Work on your project. Use the following helpers as needed:

```bash
# Check workspace health
./para status

# Scaffold a new project
./para scaffold project new-feature

# Commit and push changes
@[/push]
```

---

### 4. ✅ Verify (before closing a feature)

```
@[/verify] my-app "user authentication works end-to-end"
```

- Generates a step-by-step verification walkthrough
- Logs the result in the session

---

### 5. 🌙 End Session — `/end`

```
@[/end]
```

- Summarize completed work
- Log new TODOs for next session
- Classify any loose files into PARA (Projects / Areas / Resources / Archive)
- Notify downstream projects if changes are relevant

## 💡 Tips for `dev` Profile

- **kebab-case everything**: `my-app`, `auth-service`, `api-gateway`
- **One git repo per Project folder**: the `repo/` sub-folder is the git root
- **`_inbox/` is your capture zone**: drop notes, code snippets, links here — process later during `/end`
- **Areas are evergreen SOPs**: runbooks in `Areas/infra/` should always be accurate
- **Resources are read-only references**: don't do active work inside `Resources/`
