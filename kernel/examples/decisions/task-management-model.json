  "context": "PARA Workspace v1.4 needs a clear task management model. The previous version had no formal definition of how backlog.md, sprint-current.md, and done.md relate to each other. We needed to decide between a single-file approach, a 3-file model with sprint-current as canonical, or a hybrid model.",
  "decision": "Adopted the Hybrid 3-File Model: backlog.md is the canonical task store (primary read/write via /backlog workflow), sprint-current.md is a derived focus view showing only active tasks, and done.md is a derived archive for completed tasks.",
  "options": [

      "label": "Single file (backlog only)",
      "description": "Keep everything in backlog.md with sections for different states",
      "pros": ["Simple", "Familiar workflow"],
