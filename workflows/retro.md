## Steps

2. **Summarize Learnings**:
   - What went well?
   - What challenges were faced?
   - What can be extracted as a "Resource"?

3. **Export Skills/Gems**:
   - Move generic reusable code snippets to `Resources/Reference/code/`.
   - Add new patterns to `Resources/Reference/code/patterns/`.

4. **Archive Session**:
   - Record the retrospective in `sessions/RETROSPECTIVE.md`.
